This app features an anonymous multiplayer fridge where anything goes. Click and drag magnets into clever configurations, work with others to form sentences, or cause chaos. We won't judge.

###### We're currently hosted on a free Heroku dyno, which spins down after 30 minutes of inactivity. This resets the "magnets" to a new random layout, which is undesirable. There are currently no plans to hook a database (or any method of data perstistence, for that matter) to this trivial app, however it will be upgraded to a hobbyist (24/7) dyno in the near future.
